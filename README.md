This code creates a Patient class with properties Name, Age, Address, and PhoneNumber. In the Main method, there is a menu that allows the user to register a new patient or view the information of an existing patient. The registered patients are stored in an array of Patient objects, and the program uses a loop to allow the user to keep performing actions until they choose to exit.
